				<Heading class="mb-6">A bit about me</Heading>
				<Paragraph class="mb-6">
					I've always been a jack of all trades. I studied at a small liberal arts college in America for my undergrad, 
					and majored in Physics and Economics. I then did a masters in economics in Singapore, while developing a passion 
					for technology. After my masters, I got a chance to return to Myanmar, where I'm from, to be part of the nascent 
					tech scene there, which led me to work in data journalism and civic technology in a regional context.
				</Paragraph>


         <Paragraph class="mb-6">
					I was born in Yangon, Myanmar, but spent a good chunk of my life living in Singapore. I am currently based in 
					Chiang Mai, Thailand. From there, I lead a remote team of data analysts, developers, designers and data journalists 
					at <CustomLink href="https://site.thibi.co/" external>Thibi</CustomLink>, helping media and civil society organisations across Southeast Asia use data and technology more effectively 
					in their work.
				</Paragraph>


				<Paragraph class="mb-6">
					I love to write, and tinker, and see connections in seemingly random things. This digital garden is where I 
					cultivate those connectionsâ€”between data and storytelling, between technology and society, between the Global 
					South and the rest of the world.
