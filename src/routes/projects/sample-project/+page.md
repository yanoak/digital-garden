# Project: Digital Garden

## Overview

A personal digital garden built with SvelteKit, designed to share essays, book reviews, notes, and project write-ups in an interconnected, evolving format.

## Motivation

I wanted a space to:
- Share my learning journey
- Document my thoughts and projects
- Create a personal knowledge base
- Build in public

Traditional blogging felt too formal and rigid. A digital garden provides the freedom to publish imperfect, evolving content.

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit (for routing and SSG)
- **Content**: Markdown processed with mdsvex
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **Hosting**: Can be deployed anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

### Key Features

1. **Markdown Support**: Write content in markdown files
2. **Section Organization**: Essays, reading, notes, and projects
3. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
4. **Clean Navigation**: Easy to explore different content types
5. **Component System**: Reusable components for consistent styling
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Tags and categorization
- [ ] Backlinks between notes
- [ ] RSS feed
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Reading time estimates
- [ ] Content filtering and sorting

## Lessons Learned

- **Start simple**: Better to ship something minimal than perfect
- **Content first**: The structure can evolve as you add content
- **Markdown is powerful**: mdsvex makes it easy to add interactive components
- **Iteration is key**: A digital garden is never "done"
- **Component reusability**: Pre-defined components save time and ensure consistency
