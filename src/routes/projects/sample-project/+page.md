# Project: Digital Garden

🏷️ **Tags**: SvelteKit, Markdown, Web Development  
📅 **Date**: October 2024  
🔗 **Status**: Active

## Overview

A personal digital garden built with SvelteKit, designed to share essays, book reviews, notes, and project write-ups in an interconnected, evolving format.

## Motivation

I wanted a space to:
- Share my learning journey
- Document my thoughts and projects
- Create a personal knowledge base
- Build in public

Traditional blogging felt too formal and rigid. A digital garden provides the freedom to publish imperfect, evolving content.

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit (for routing and SSG)
- **Content**: Markdown processed with mdsvex
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (keeping it simple)
- **Hosting**: Can be deployed anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

### Key Features

1. **Markdown Support**: Write content in markdown files
2. **Section Organization**: Essays, book reviews, notes, and projects
3. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
4. **Clean Navigation**: Easy to explore different content types

### Project Structure

```
src/routes/
  ├── +page.svelte (home)
  ├── +layout.svelte (shared layout)
  ├── essays/
  │   ├── +page.svelte (listing)
  │   └── [slug]/+page.md (individual essays)
  ├── book-reviews/
  ├── notes/
  └── projects/
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Tags and categorization
- [ ] Backlinks between notes
- [ ] RSS feed
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Reading time estimates

## Lessons Learned

- **Start simple**: Better to ship something minimal than perfect
- **Content first**: The structure can evolve as you add content
- **Markdown is powerful**: mdsvex makes it easy to add interactive components
- **Iteration is key**: A digital garden is never "done"
